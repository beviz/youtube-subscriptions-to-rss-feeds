   <ns2:description>What is the aspect of being you that you cling to most tightly? Why are you you and not somebody else? How do you understand and make sense of your experiences? These are questions studied by Anil Seth, Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience and the University of Sussex. Anil and Chris reflect on the limitations in describing the brain as a “supercomputer,” the ethical and morally grey areas of technological advancements and brain computer interfaces, and how hallucinogenic drugs affect consciousness.

   <ns2:description>Apple’s latest entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M5 chip is here, and while it may look familiar, there are some solid performance gains under the hood. In this video, I go hands-on with the new model to see how it stacks up to last year’s M4 MacBook Pro and whether it’s worth upgrading.

The M5 chip brings up to 15% faster CPU, 30% faster graphics, and 45% faster ray tracing compared to the M4 — plus new AI-focused optimizations that deliver serious boosts in real-world workloads. But is that enough to justify the upgrade? I’ll walk through benchmarks, SSD speed tests, display differences, and who this MacBook is really for.

   <ns2:description>Imagine this: you walk into a room, and your dog is on a video call with their fellow canine friends. Computer scientist Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas thinks the notion of a social internet for animals is not far off. She explores what happens when animals control their own technology — from parrots making friends online to monkeys choosing their favorite audio tracks — and shows how this technology transforms our understanding of animal consciousness. (Recorded at TEDxManchester on March 1, 2025)

When Steve Jobs introduced the original iPhone, he said, "we’ve designed something wonderful for your hand." And I honestly think that was an understatement. I remember holding the first iPhone and just saying, “wow.”

Since then, only two models gave me that feeling. The iPhone X eight years ago, and this iPhone Air today. It is, without a doubt, the most wonderful phone for your hand. So why, then, aren't customers buying the iPhone Air nearly as often as the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, or iPhone 17 Pro Max models?</ns2:description>

   <ns2:description>Amazon Inspector offers continuous monitoring of your Amazon EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities without installing an agent or additional software. With this capability, you can expand your vulnerability assessment coverage across your EC2 infrastructure with Amazon Inspector agentless scanning for EC2 instances that do not have SSM Agents installed or configured. For agentless scanning, Amazon Inspector takes snapshots of EBS volumes to collect software application inventory from the instances to perform vulnerability assessments. Once you enable EC2 scanning within Amazon Inspector, it automatically discovers all your EC2 instances and starts evaluating them for software vulnerabilities. Customers can enable agentless scanning by simply visiting the EC2 settings page within the Amazon Inspector console and selecting hybrid scan mode. In hybrid scan mode, Amazon Inspector relies on SSM Agents to collect information from instances to perform vulnerability assessments, and automatically switches to agentless scanning for instances that do not have SSM Agents installed or configured.

會員級別變更方法
1. 用電腦或筆電開啟yt 找到老師頻道的主頁，然後在首頁、影片 那一列的最右手邊會看到一個“齒輪”，點進去會看到“更變級別”
2. 用手機開啟瀏覽器 然後瀏覽器要設定是以電腦視窗顯示，此時顯示畫面會變很小 因為是以電腦的螢幕大小做的排版，然後收尋yt 長壓後點擊以新視窗開啟，之後的動作一樣 找到老師頻道主頁 然後在右手邊找到齒輪 點擊後找到更變級別。

   <ns2:description>I just discovered the future of power tools — and it’s happening right here in Guangzhou, at the world’s biggest trade fair: The Canton Fair 2025! 🇨🇳
From next-gen mowers to intelligent tools and unstoppable innovation, this year’s Canton Fair proves why China remains the global hub of manufacturing and creativity.

In this video, I explore the 138th China Import and Export Fair, better known as the Canton Fair, where over 32,000 companies are showcasing cutting-edge technology, intelligent manufacturing, and green energy solutions.
I came across one brand that really stood out — redefining what outdoor power equipment can do with advanced engineering, bold design, and world-class quality.

If you’ve ever wondered how China’s manufacturers are shaping the future of global trade — this is the place to see it.
Join me as I take you inside the energy, innovation, and business behind the world’s largest trade fair!

   <ns2:description>新 Vision Pro 没叫 2，但芯片换了、刷新率高了、佩戴变了，重量也“出事”了。苹果说这是“更轻的体验”，可数字却更重了。到底是怎么回事？

   <ns2:description>一年 1000 家店，从 0 到 100 亿，为了 IP 业务转型要求做事的人一年至少浪费 1 个亿……这些数字既是一个狂飙突进商业奇迹的见证，也是一连串坐标，带我们了解这个奇迹是如何具体而微地被构建出来的。

对于任何一个想要探求商业运作背后机制和原理的人，这场访谈都是一次令人兴奋的旅程。过去这些年，中国企业家创造了太多激动人心，光彩夺目的商业故事，叶国富和他的名创优品无疑是其中异常璀璨的一个。将近三个小时的篇幅里，听他讲述如何从“卖杂货”起始，到加盟店开遍全球，随即成为中国最会玩 IP 的企业之一，继而又义无反顾投身被视为夕阳产业的超市领域，每一步都兼具敏锐的判断和扎实的执行。他是怎么做到的？

《罗永浩的十字路口》第八期，我们和叶国富一起聊聊他的线下零售世界。</ns2:description>

0:00 介紹：正常細胞與癌細胞
1:30 正常細胞，為何切換為癌細胞？
3:28 線粒體被破壞的原因
4:33 了解癌細胞
5:45 要加到癌預防措施的重要物質
7:01 亞甲藍是什麼？
8:50 進一步了解亞甲藍！

柏格醫生dr berg:所有癌細胞，都來自正常細胞。
將深入探討，導致正常細胞切換為癌細胞的原因。

線粒體吸收食物，並轉化為ATP(細胞的能量貨幣)。

線粒體也儲存電子。線粒體的電子傳輸鏈，參與ATP能量儲存(食物轉為ATP)，促成能量。

第4複合物，是電子傳輸鏈最後階段，稱為細胞色素C氧化酶。當它出現功能障礙，會觸發正常細胞，切換為異常癌細胞。

一旦細胞切換為癌細胞，就不再產生氧。為了生存，身體開啟線粒體外的古老基因，去適應無氧生存，這就是癌。

關於癌，全新觀點是：在無氧環境，適應生存的細胞。 至於氧呢？它變少了，稱為缺氧。

還有一種基因，稱為缺氧誘導因子1α(HIF-1α)，促使正常細胞切換為癌細胞。它與缺氧有關。而缺氧，與正常細胞切換為癌細胞有關。

關於癌，我做了很多影片，提供預防措施、不同策略，並告訴你該吃什麼食物和營養。但有件重要事，其他影片沒談過，要加在預防措施中，叫做亞甲藍。

亞甲藍就像吸收電子的海綿，專門針對第4複合物，會繞過第4複合物，再次製造氧氣和ATP。

低劑量亞甲藍，有效，建議20~40滴，加水服用。亞甲藍有3級，要選醫藥級(USP級)。請先與你的醫生討論亞甲藍的抗癌作用。

時間標示
0:00 生酮飲食時，酮不高的5原因
1:03 3.蛋白質過多
2:13 食物含適量蛋白質和高脂肪

柏格醫生 dr berg 談：生酮飲食時，酮不高的5原因。

1.生酮初期，粒線體尚未進入生酮。
2.數據來自尿酮或血酮測試？初期測尿酮即可。
3.蛋白質過多，觸發胰島素，延緩生酮狀態。
4.壓力(作用像糖)，觸發皮質醇，使酮變少。
5.睡眠不足，擾亂血糖，較難徹底進入生酮狀態

柏格醫生 dr berg 談：缺甲鈷胺(Methylcobalamin)的第1跡象。

甲鈷胺是B12，對基因、紅血球和髓鞘至關重要。B12也有助保健脊柱和大腦。

缺B12 的症狀:
1. 可能導致刺痛、麻木或灼熱感。
2. 慢性疼痛
3. 憂鬱
4. 肌肉消失
5. 視力模糊
6. 耳鳴
7. 貧血
8. 口腔潰瘍
9. 咽喉痛
10. 掉髮

過多B12也可能出現症狀。若吃過多合成B12(氰鈷胺)而非天然B12(甲鈷胺)，通常會出現B12毒性。

氰鈷胺會累積體內，引起8症狀：
1.痘痘(Acne)
2.心悸
3.焦慮
4.臉頰發紅
5.頭痛
6.失眠
7.靜坐不能(Akathisia)
8.自殺念頭

在感覺到任何影響前，您可能早已缺B12。但這並不表示沒造成任何損害。您最終會感覺到的第1症狀是極度疲勞。

高B12食物是動物性產品，植物不含B12。

缺B12主要原因：
1.吃素或全素
2.吸收不良
3.胃繞道手術
4.胃萎縮
5.胃炎
6.幽門螺旋桿菌感染
7.潰瘍
8.腸道發炎
9.吃阿斯匹林
10.喝酒
11.吃垃圾食品
12.吃抗生素
13.吃制酸劑或胃藥(PPIs)
14.吃避孕藥
15.懷孕或哺乳期
16.吸菸
17.基因問題，稱基因突變(Polymorphism)

   <ns2:description>欢迎来到404档案馆，在这里，我们一起穿越中国数字高墙。

尽管中国的言论审查和舆论管控日趋严峻，国家对公民的监控也无处不在，但我们依然可以看那些不服从的个体，顶着被删号、被约谈、甚至被监禁的风险，对不公义勇敢发出自己的声音。

中国数字时代在“404文库”栏目中长期收录这些被当局审查机制删除的声音。如果您也不希望这些声音就这样消失，请随手将它们转发给您可以转发的任何人。

在本期的【404文库】栏目中，我们将选读过去一周中引起舆论关注的三篇404文章：

一、海边的西塞罗｜老西觉得，胡锡进老师说的对
二、建设性意见｜一场烟花秀，把县委县政府领导班子“一窝端”了
三、建设性意见｜基孔肯雅热确诊超2万例，一个重症都没有

   <ns2:description>Apple just announced the new iPad Pro with the M5 chip — and I’ve got the 13-inch 512 GB model in Space Black to test. In this hands-on first look I walk through what’s new: the M5 chip (up to 15% faster CPU, 35% faster GPU), the new Wi-Fi 7/N1 chip, the C1X modem, faster SSD, updated RAM options, and more.

I’ll dive into the real-world performance comparisons vs the previous gen (M4), including Geekbench results. Plus I’ll cover whether the upgrade is worth it if you already own an iPad Pro.

👉 If you’re curious about how the M5 handles AI tasks, external displays, fast charging, or large-file workflows — drop a comment below and I’ll include those tests in the full review.

   <ns2:description>Palm oil is in nearly every commodity you use — food, shampoo, makeup and more — but harvesting this essential material has contributed to the destruction of millions of hectares of forests globally. Sustainability leader Andika Putraditama shares how a groundbreaking collaboration between conservationists and global brands is turning this crisis on its head, unlocking a new model for forest preservation. Discover a vision for preserving the forests still standing and restoring the ones we’ve lost. (Recorded at TED Countdown: Overcoming Dilemmas in the Green Transition on October 30, 2024)

   <ns2:description>📑 My blogpost on the CORE #workflow: https://www.jeffsu.org/i-taught-6-642-googlers-this-productivity-system

I'm sharing the exact #productivity system I taught to over 6,600 Google employees over nine years.

The CORE workflow handles all four types of workplace information through a simple four-step process: Capture everything immediately, Organize with minimal friction, Review during scheduled sessions, and Engage by blocking time to execute.

Trust me when I tell you it works with any tool you already use and becomes automatic within two weeks. No more relying on memory or willpower alone!

   <ns2:description>We’re very bullish on the handheld future of gaming. But we’re not bullish on the new ROG Xbox Ally. The Verge’s Sean Hollister joins the show to explain why this Xbox-branded device barely feels like an Xbox, and why it’s definitely not a threat to the Steam Deck, before he and David debate whether the future of Xbox is even in good hands. After that, The Verge’s Hayden Field walks David through a couple of important recent studies, asking the same basic question: is AI making us dumb? Finally, Sean returns to answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about hybrid computers, which are an extremely 2012 idea and also maybe the future of computing. But probably not. #Vergecast #Technology #Podcast

會員級別變更方法
1. 用電腦或筆電開啟yt 找到老師頻道的主頁，然後在首頁、影片 那一列的最右手邊會看到一個“齒輪”，點進去會看到“更變級別”
2. 用手機開啟瀏覽器 然後瀏覽器要設定是以電腦視窗顯示，此時顯示畫面會變很小 因為是以電腦的螢幕大小做的排版，然後收尋yt 長壓後點擊以新視窗開啟，之後的動作一樣 找到老師頻道主頁 然後在右手邊找到齒輪 點擊後找到更變級別。
